# 1.0 FeverApp
**Modern fever research and advice for parents**
**Competent support on the subject of fever**
FeverApp is unique in fever monitoring and was co-developed by the associations of pediatric and adolescent physicians.  
Supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the app was developed under the direction of the pediatrician Prof. Dr. David Martin of the University of Witten/Herdecke in cooperation with the Professional Association of Pediatricians (BVKJ) and the German Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine (DGKJ).
The app provides parents with scientifically sound information to help them safely accompany their child in the event of a fever.
